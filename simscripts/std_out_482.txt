In the cell environment, you see: 
	LARG is not activated.
	GEF-H1 is not activated.
	Fibronectin-binding Integrin has no tension applied.

Action: look
In the cell environment, you see:

	Fibronectin-binding Integrin has no tension applied.


Action: apply tension
Tension applied to Fibronectin-binding Integrin.

Action: activate LARG
LARG activated via Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn.

Action: activate GEF-H1
GEF-H1 activated via ERK.

Claim Supported: GEFs mediate RhoA activation in response to tension.
