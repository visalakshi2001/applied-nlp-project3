In the environment, you see: 
	A microtubule named microtubule_1 with acetylation level 0 and transport status impaired.
	LRRK2 protein named LRRK2_mutant with mutation status mutated.

Action: look
In the environment, you see: 
	A microtubule named microtubule_1 with acetylation level 0 and transport status impaired.
	LRRK2 protein named LRRK2_mutant with mutation status mutated.


Action: increase acetylation of microtubule_1
You increase the acetylation of microtubule_1.

Claim Supported: Increased microtubule acetylation repairs interference of axonal transport.
