Inflammatory Cycle
Autoantibodies present: Autoantibody against Citrullinated Vimentin, Autoantibody against Citrullinated Fibrinogen
Neutrophils present: Neutrophil 1, Neutrophil 2

Claim Supported: Citrullinated proteins externalized in neutrophil extracellular traps act indirectly to perpetuate the inflammatory cycle via induction of autoantibodies.
