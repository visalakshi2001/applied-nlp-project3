In the environment, you see: 
	A reactive oxygen species named ROS_1 with damage level 0.
	An oncogene named BCR/ABL contributing to genomic instability with level 0.

Action: look
In the environment, you see: 
	A reactive oxygen species named ROS_1 with damage level 0.
	An oncogene named BCR/ABL contributing to genomic instability with level 0.


Action: tick ROS_1
ROS_1 has been ticked, updating its properties.

Action: tick BCR/ABL
BCR/ABL has been ticked, updating its properties.

Claim Supported: The removal of reactive oxygen species by activated oncogenes contributes to the increased genomic instability of leukaemia cells.
