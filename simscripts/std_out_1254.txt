Initial State:
In the Neural Progenitor Environment, you see: 
	A Primate neural progenitor with a proliferation rate of 5.
	A Rodent neural progenitor with a proliferation rate of 2.

After tick:
In the Neural Progenitor Environment, you see: 
	A Primate neural progenitor with a proliferation rate of 6.
	A Rodent neural progenitor with a proliferation rate of 3.


After tick:
In the Neural Progenitor Environment, you see: 
	A Primate neural progenitor with a proliferation rate of 7.
	A Rodent neural progenitor with a proliferation rate of 4.


After tick:
In the Neural Progenitor Environment, you see: 
	A Primate neural progenitor with a proliferation rate of 8.
	A Rodent neural progenitor with a proliferation rate of 5.


Claim Supported: The proliferative capacity of neural progenitors differs across species.
