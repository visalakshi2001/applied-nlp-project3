In the cell environment, you see: 
	JMJD6 with hydroxylation rate: 1.0
	p53 with hydroxylation level: 0.0

Action: look
In the cell environment, you see: 
	JMJD6 with hydroxylation rate: 1.0
	p53 with hydroxylation level: 0.0


Action: inhibit hydroxylation
JMJD6 has inhibited hydroxylation. p53 hydroxylation level updated.

Claim Supported: JMJD6 slows the hydroxylation of C-terminal lysine.
