In the environment, you see: 
	A LRRK2 Neuron with acetylation level 0 and locomotor deficit 0.

Action: increase acetylation of LRRK2 Neuron
You increase the acetylation of LRRK2 Neuron by 1.

Action: increase acetylation of LRRK2 Neuron
You increase the acetylation of LRRK2 Neuron by 1.

Action: look
In the environment, you see: 
	A LRRK2 Neuron with acetylation level 2 and locomotor deficit 6.


Claim Supported: Increased microtubule acetylation exacerbates locomotor deficits.
