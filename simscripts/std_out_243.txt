In the environment, you see: 
	A embryonic_stem_cell with replication timing 0, transcription level 0, and nuclear position 0.

Action: differentiate embryonic_stem_cell
embryonic_stem_cell has differentiated.

Action: look
In the environment, you see: 
	A embryonic_stem_cell with replication timing 1, transcription level 1, and nuclear position 1.


Claim Supported: Cellular differentiation of embryonic stem cells is accompanied by changes in replication timing and transcription.
