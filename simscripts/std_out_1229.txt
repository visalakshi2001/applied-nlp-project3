In the cell environment, you see: 
	microtubule_1
	adhesion_site_1

Action: deliver MMPs
You deliver MMPs from microtubule_1.

Action: disassemble adhesion site
You disassemble adhesion_site_1.

Action: look
In the cell environment, you see: 
	microtubule_1
	adhesion_site_1


Claim Supported: The microtubule-dependent delivery and secretion of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) is partially responsible for the disassembly of adhesion sites.
