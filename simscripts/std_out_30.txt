In the breast_cancer_treatment_environment, you see: 
	Patient A is a patient with extensive metabolism. Recurrence rate: 14.9%, Mortality rate: 16.7%.
	Patient B is a patient with heterozygous metabolism. Recurrence rate: 20.9%, Mortality rate: 18.0%.
	Patient C is a patient with poor metabolism. Recurrence rate: 29.0%, Mortality rate: 22.8%.

For extensive metabolizers: Recurrence Rate = 14.9%, Mortality Rate = 16.7%.
For heterozygous metabolizers: Recurrence Rate = 20.9%, Mortality Rate = 18.0%.
For poor metabolizers: Recurrence Rate = 29.0%, Mortality Rate = 22.8%.

Conclusion: The simulation shows that a breast cancer patient's capacity to metabolize tamoxifen (CYP2D6 variation) influences treatment outcomes, supporting the claim.
