In the cellular environment, you see: 
	A fibroblast with focal adhesion active, mechanical strain of 0, and scarring level of 0.

Action: inhibit focal adhesion of fibroblast
You inhibited focal adhesion of fibroblast.

Action: apply mechanical strain to fibroblast
You applied mechanical strain to fibroblast.

Action: look
In the cellular environment, you see: 
	A fibroblast with focal adhesion inactive, mechanical strain of 10, and scarring level of 5.0.


Claim Supported: Inhibiting focal adhesion formation enables cells to convert mechanical strain into eventual scarring.
