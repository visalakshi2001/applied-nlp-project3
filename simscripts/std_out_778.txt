In the environment, you see: 
	A Mouse with SIRT1 with SIRT1 present, obesity status: False, insulin resistance status: False.
	A Mouse without SIRT1 with SIRT1 absent, obesity status: False, insulin resistance status: False.

Action: look
In the environment, you see: 
	A Mouse with SIRT1 with SIRT1 present, obesity status: False, insulin resistance status: False.
	A Mouse without SIRT1 with SIRT1 absent, obesity status: False, insulin resistance status: False.


Claim is Refuted: Mice lacking Sirt1 in Sf1-expressing neurons are NOT immune to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.
